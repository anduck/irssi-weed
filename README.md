# weed - XChat based theme for irssi

This is an updated version of [ronilaukkarinen/weed](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/weed). All congratulations go to him.

Primarily the scripts have been updated. However, some of the config had to be adapted to this. I have added `smartfilter.pl`.


## Usage

* Change your username in the `config` file.
* Adapt your `config` further to your requirements.
* Start chatting around.


## The following scripts are used:

* adv_windowlist.pl
* awaybar.pl
* nickcolor_expando.pl
* smartfilter.pl
* trackbar22.pl

Check also the `startup` file.
Look into the `perl/core/scripts` area in the `config` file. The settings for the scripts are set there.
