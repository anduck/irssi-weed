This is an updated version of [ronilaukkarinen/weed](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/weed). All congratulations go to him. Primarily the scripts have been updated. However, some of the config had to be adapted to this.

I have added `smartfilter.pl`.


## Usage

* Change your username `{{ username }}` and your quit message `{{ quitmessage }}` in the `config` file.
* Adapt your `config` further to your requirements.
* Start chatting around.


## The following scripts are used:

* adv_windowlist.pl
* awaybar.pl
* nickcolor_expando.pl
* smartfilter.pl
* trackbar22.pl

Look into the `perl/core/scripts` area in the `config` file. The settings for the scripts are set there. Check also the `startup` file.
